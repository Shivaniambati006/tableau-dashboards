# My Tableau Dashboards

Hi! I’m a student learning Tableau, and this repo is where I share the dashboards I create as I practice and improve.

## Dashboards Included

- **HR Analytics** – Exploring employee data like attrition and demographics  
- **Sales Superstore** – Analyzing sales and profits from the Superstore dataset  
- **Customer Churn** – Visualizing customer retention and loss patterns  
- **Financial Trends** – Checking how financial data changes over time

## Files

- `.twbx` — Tableau packaged workbooks you can open in Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public  
- `data/` — The datasets used in my dashboards (CSV files)  
- `images/` — Screenshots of the dashboards for a quick look

## How to Use

1. Download the `.twbx` files to open them in Tableau.  
2. Use the data files if you want to explore or try building your own dashboards.  
3. Check out the images folder for previews of the dashboards.

## About Me

I’m learning Tableau to build my data visualization skills. Feedback and suggestions are welcome!
